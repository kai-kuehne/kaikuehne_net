        <r-cell span="1-4">
            <p>I won't be going into much detail about aspects that are covered in depth in the Ableton Push 2 MIDI
                and
                Display Interface Manual. However, I will be talking about my overall approach, how the program
                produces
                sounds, and by far the most challenging aspect: how to display an image on the Push 2 display.</p>

            <p>The program itself runs on the computer and communicates with the Ableton Push 2 over USB. To
                summarize,
                here's what it does:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Receive pressed pads:</strong> Continuously read MIDI messages sent by the Push when
                    pads
                    are
                    pressed.</li>
                <li><strong>Update pad colors:</strong> This is done by sending MIDI messages to the Push.</li>
                <li><strong>Play sounds:</strong> Synthesize sounds using TinySoundFont, a single-header synthesizer
                    for
                    SoundFonts.</li>
                <li><strong>Update Push screen:</strong> Composite an image using Cairo, convert it to the Push
                    screen
                    format, and transmit it via USB.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm omitting details about points 1 and 2 – but TL;DR is: I'm using <a
                    href="https://github.com/PortMidi/portmidi">PortMIDI</a> for the bi-directional MIDI
                communication
                with
                the Push through its "User Port".</p>

            <h3>How to Play Sounds</h3>
            <p>
                The application I’ve built is a standalone synthesizer, not a
                VST plugin. Unlike setups where MIDI events are sent to an
                external synthesizer to generate sound, this application handles
                sound generation directly. It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont">SoundFonts</a>
                to
                produce audio, with the core synthesis work handled by the <a
                    href="https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont">TinySoundFont</a>
                library by <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@schelling">Bernhard
                    Schelling</a>. For playback of the resulting PCM data, I rely on
                <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2">SDL</a>,
                which is also used for the application’s window rendering, input
                handling, and other system-level functionality.
            </p>

            <p>This aspect of the application has been surprisingly straightforward:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Find a nice SoundFont: I used <a
                        href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts?tags=soundfont">musical-artifacts.com</a> to
                    find
                    fonts I like.</li>
                <li>Tell TinySoundFont which SoundFont to use.</li>
                <li>Tell it which MIDI note to play.</li>
                <li>Write a callback that uses the retrieved PCM data and SDL to play the audio through the
                    computer's
                    audio
                    device.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><img src="how-to-play-sounds.svg"></p>

            <p>You can check out <a
                    href="https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont/blob/main/examples/example1.c">this
                    example code</a> from the <a
                    href="https://github.com/schellingb/TinySoundFont/tree/main">TinySoundFont
                    GitHub repository</a> if you’re interested in the code. I basically did the same thing.</p>

            <p>This has been simple to do because TinySoundFont is just a single file. No dependencies, it just
                works.
            </p>

            <h3>Showing an Image on the Push Screen</h3>
            <p>The goal of this application is to help me learn and discover chords using the Push. <em>I just want
                    to
                    play</em> and have the Push tell me what I’m playing — it acts as an assistant. Since I was
                aiming
                to
                <ins>break away from the computer screen</ins>, it was important to display the chord information
                directly
                on the Push’s screen. While the software still runs on a computer, I don’t need to look at it — I
                can
                just
                close the lid and play.
            </p>

            <p><img src="push-screen.png"></p>

            <p>Okay, on to the technical part: The most important thing to understand is that the Push doesn’t offer
                a
                drawing API. Its display behaves like a standard screen expecting raw pixel data in <a
                    href="https://github.com/Ableton/push-interface/blob/main/doc/AbletonPush2MIDIDisplayInterface.asc#display-interface">a
                    specific format</a>, and all communication happens over USB. The display runs at 60 FPS, so
                updates
                need
                to be sent quickly. My implementation is very loosely based on <a
                    href="https://github.com/Ableton/push2-display-with-juce">this example provided by Ableton</a>,
                but
                my
                code is written in plain C rather than C++, and I’m also not using JUCE.</p>

            <p>This is how it works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Composite an image using <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>. This creates an
                    image
                    like
                    the one up top, in RGB24 format.</li>
                <li>Transform the pixel data into a form that the Push screen expects. This is <a
                        href="https://github.com/Ableton/push-interface/blob/main/doc/AbletonPush2MIDIDisplayInterface.asc#324-xoring-pixel-data">explained
                        in detail here</a>.</li>
                <li>Send the pixel data to the Push screen via USB. This turned out to be by far the hardest part
                    for
                    me, as
                    I hadn’t worked with USB communication before. I’m using the <a
                        href="https://libusb.sourceforge.io/api-1.0/libusb_io.html">async API of libusb</a> to send
                    pixel
                    data as quickly as possible.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Wrap up</h2>
            <p>The code is still in a prototype state, and for now, I’m not planning to open source it. That said,
                if
                there’s interest, I’d definitely consider it. This was also my first real application written in C,
                and
                along the way I learned a lot — especially about memory management, memory leaks (naturally), and
                how to
                track them down and fix them. Talking about this is due another time though.</p>
