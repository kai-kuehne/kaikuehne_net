            <p>
                Welcome to <b><i>Found; Not Lost</i></b> where I share
                links to cool things I find online. What's cool?
                Programming, Design, Game Development, Music
                Production and everything in between. There will
                probably be an occasional random link as well, and
                maybe even artwork or a super insightful&nbsp;quote.
