I'm Kai Kühne, a backend engineer in Berlin specializing in distributed systems and infrastructure.

I've built scalable systems at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) and [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/) using Go, Scala, and Python. In my free time, I explore game development, audio programming, and real-time graphics.

## Recent

**[Found; Not Lost](/found)** — Curated links on programming, design, game development, and music production.

I also make games at **[tapirmakes.games](https://tapirmakes.games)**
